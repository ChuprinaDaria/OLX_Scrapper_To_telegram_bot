## üíª How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChuprinaDaria/OLX_Scrapper_To_telegram_bot.git
cd OLX_Scrapper_To_telegram_bot
``` 

## 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create and Configure .env File

The bot relies on several environment variables to function properly. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```bash
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token
CHAT_IDS=123456789,987654321
OLX_URLS=https://www.olx.pl/your-page,https://www.olx.pl/another-page
CHECK_INTERVAL=180
```

### Example

- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token (get it from BotFather on Telegram).
- `CHAT_IDS`: A comma-separated list of chat IDs where the bot will send ads (you can get the chat ID from @userinfobot).
- `OLX_URLS`: A list of URLs from OLX that you want to monitor.
- `CHECK_INTERVAL`: How often (in seconds) the bot will check for new ads. The default is 180 seconds.

### 4. Run the Bot

After configuring the environment variables, you can run the bot:

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will start checking for new ads and send them to the specified Telegram channels.

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can configure:

- The list of OLX URLs to monitor by updating `OLX_URLS`.
- The hashtags for categories in the `CATEGORY_HASHTAGS` dictionary.
- The check interval between ad checks in `CHECK_INTERVAL`.
